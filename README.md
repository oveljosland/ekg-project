# EKG Hardware Project

⚠️ Note: This project is a work in progress. Features and documentation may change frequently.

## Overview
This repository contains the design and documentation files for an EKG hardware project in an Electronics Design course. The project includes schematics, PCB layouts, useful scripts, and other design resources created using **KiCad**.

## Features
- **Modular design**: Allows easy modifications and improvements.
- **Open-source**: All design files and documentation are freely available.

## Repository Contents
- `ekg-interface/`- Design files for the EKG interface.
- `step-down/` - Design files for the step-down converter.
